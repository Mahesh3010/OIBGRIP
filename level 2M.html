                    <p>Shivaji Bhonsale Ialso referred to as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was an Indian ruler and 
                    a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan. Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining 
                    Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur which formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally 
                    crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort. Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both 
                    alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and the 
                    European colonial powers.</p><br>
                    <p>Military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and 
                    building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule with 
                    well-structured administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions 
                    and promoted the usage of the Marathi and Sanskrit languages, replacing Persian in court and administration.
                    Shivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but nearly two centuries after his death, he began to take 
                    on increased importance with the emergence of the Indian independence movement, as many Indian nationalists 
                    elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.</p><br>
                    <p>Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near the city of Junnar, which is now in Pune district. 
                    Scholars disagree on his date of birth. The Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday 
                    commemorating Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti). Shivaji was named after a local deity, the goddess Shivai.
                    Shivaji's father Shahaji Bhonsle was a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanates. His mother was Jijabai 
                    the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed, a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from a Yadav royal 
                    family of Devagiri.</p>
                    <br><p>Shivaji belonged to Maratha family of Bhonsle clan. His paternal grandfather Maloji (1552–1597) was an 
                    influential general of Ahmadnagar Sultanate, and was awarded the epithet of "Raja". He was given deshmukhi rights 
                    of Pune, Supe, Chakan and Indapur for military expenses. He was also given Fort Shivneri for his family's residence (c. 1590).
                    At the time of Shivaji's birth, power in the Deccan was shared by three Islamic sultanates: Bijapur, 
                    Ahmednagar, and Golkonda. Shahaji often changed his loyalty between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the Adilshah of Bijapur
                    and the Mughals, but always kept his jagir (fiefdom) at Pune and his small army.</p>
